    <p> Tapestry is a form of textile art which was traditionally woven by hand on a loom. Normally it is used to create <em>images</em> rather than patterns. Tapestry is relatively fragile, and difficult to make, so most historical pieces are intended to hang <strong>vertically on a wall</strong> (or sometimes in tents), or sometimes <strong>horizontally over a piece of furniture</strong> such as a table or bed. Some periods made smaller pieces, often long and narrow and used as borders for other textiles. Most weavers use a <strong>natural warp thread</strong>, such as wool, linen, or cotton. The weft threads are usually wool or cotton but may include silk, gold, silver, or other alternatives. </p>
